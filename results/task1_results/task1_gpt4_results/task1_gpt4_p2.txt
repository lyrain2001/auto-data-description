4c344d31-fe88-4f6d-945f-b2469b667163	This dataset provides detailed wind measurements, focusing on wind speed, direction, and variability. Structured in a tabular format with columns: Time Stamp, Average Wind Speed, Standard Deviation, Average Wind Direction. The data types include numerical and date-time formats. The 'Time Stamp' indicates the measurement time, 'Average Wind Speed' and 'Standard Deviation' quantify wind speed and variability, and 'Average Wind Direction' provides directional data. Values include time (in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM format), wind speed and standard deviation (numerical), and wind direction (degrees). Time is represented in 'MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM' format, allowing for temporal wind pattern analysis. Location details are not explicit, indicating either a single-location study or the need for external geographical context. Potential concerns include data completeness, consistency, and measurement intervals. The dataset is ideal for analyzing wind behavior, potentially valuable for meteorological studies or renewable energy assessment.
