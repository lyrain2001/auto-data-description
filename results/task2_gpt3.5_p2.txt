Second, the search engine can utilize natural language processing techniques to understand the context of the query and provide more accurate results. For example, if a user searches for "schools with high lunch program participation", the search engine can identify relevant columns such as Total Average Daily Participation (ADP) and Total Free Meals Served to provide a list of schools with high participation rates. Finally, the search engine can implement autocomplete functionality to suggest relevant keywords as the user types, making it easier for users to find the desired information.
